# Machine Learning

The following 4 machine learning regression algorithms have been implemented from scratch:

- Nearest Neighbor
- Linear Regression
- Regression Forest
- Gaussian Process Regression

In order to use these algorithms you will need pip3 which includes Python 3 and then you will need to add the 'click' and 'numpy' modules.

The following command is required to run an algorithm on a given dataset:

`python3 main.py --model [MODEL] --dataset [DATASET] --[PARAMETER] [VALUE]`
